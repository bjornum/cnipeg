# BreadCrumbs

## Description

### What is it?
Breadcrumbs are the little text "steppers" displaying where you are within a nested page.
Allowing one to easily backtrack to an previous step / page

### Implementation
Simply copy and use.

### Warning / Note
This breadcrumb component are based upon a few things.
1. Main thing, are the Vue Router. 
  - If having it implemented within the project, then it will be of no problem.
2. Pre-existing pages,  simply change these to the pages of your choice.
3. Localstorage for some user conditionals, but this have been phased out.
  - So dont have to worry much about it.
