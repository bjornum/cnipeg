# Components


## Goal
  - To have an open component, where all you need to do are copy paste its folder, and all functionalities works.
    - With some direct adjustments, given through its README.md file.
  - When working with new projects, it should not take long to easily implement its new changes.
  - Be it new colour design, logo or whatever.

## Components List
  1. Global
    - Navbar, Footer, Contact dialog.
  2. NewsModule
  3. TrainingModules
  4. LanguageControll
    - Implementation of i18n
  5. Misc
    - Under development

## Future plans
  - Cleanup in the components.
    - Removal of unused code.
    - General css (avoiding repetitions)
    - trainingmodule -> taskdata need a refactor
  - Safely removal of the dialogs folder.
  - RSS prototype display, with either link to external pages, or opening of a dialog.
